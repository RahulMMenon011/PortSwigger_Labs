This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

Using Burp Suite we intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
By Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1-- we are able to see the unreleased products.

These are the released products under the Gifts category section.

Captured the http request in burp suite.

After using the `'+OR+1=1--` we were able to see the unreleased products under the category Gifts

here the payload is `'+OR+1=1--`

* +: This represents a space character in URL encoding.

* OR: This is a logical operator in SQL that returns true if any of the conditions it connects is true.

* 1=1: This is a simple condition that is always true.

* --: This is the SQL comment syntax.
