This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user.

The payload `administrator'--` was given under the my account section as the username

we were able to successfully login as the administartor

here the payload is `administartor'--` as the username

In this case, the double dash -- comments out the rest of the original query, effectively ignoring the password check. If the database system allows this injection and if 'administrator' is a valid username, it could potentially log in as the 'administrator' without needing a valid password.
