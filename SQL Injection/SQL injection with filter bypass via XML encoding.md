This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in its stock check feature. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a users table, which contains the usernames and passwords of registered users. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack to retrieve the admin user's credentials, then log in to their account.
